                <p class="ReflectionText">In this unit, I have learned how to set up a basic HTML document - which includes how to use all the different tags appropriately. Also, during my lab sessions, I fully understand how both Classes and IDs, along with the difference between them both - and when to use them. Before, I didn't fully understand the difference between them, as I have done web development before (as part of my A-Level ICT course), though the lectures and lab session have benefited me in order to understand this unit in more detail. Even though I have done web development before, in the past, I did not understand CSS. Nonetheless, during the course of this unit, I fully understand how CSS works thanks to the lab sessions; the benefit of this is that I can style web pages the way I want, without having to ask for assistance or help. Overall, I think this is my best unit out of the four - the reason is that I have done web development before, and I find it fascinating how you can implement so many things on a website. However, even though this is my strongest unit, I did find responsiveness quite difficult to implement on my website, unfortunately.

                <h1 class="UnitsTitle">Personal Reflection (Programming)</h1>
                <p class="ReflectionText">Out of all the units I study, I feel that this unit is the most difficult because I am new to programming and I have never done it before. I have learned a lot in this unit - for example: I have learned the basics of Java using X and Y coordinates, in order to draw basic lines and shapes on screen - this is something that I find quite easy. Further to that, I have learned more complex principles of Java - this includes procedures, loops and animations - I find animations and procedures quite difficult to understand at the moment, whereas, with loops, I do understand them thanks to a bit of practise. I feel that I need to spend more time on animations and procedures, so I have a better understanding on how they work; and so that I can do it myself. As well as that, I do enjoy this unit because I feel that I am gaining the skills and knowledge in order to be more successful in the future. However, I must put more time and work into this unit when it comes to my spare time.
