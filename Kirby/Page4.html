            <!--h1 is a class because it is used multiple times on the document-->
            <p class="MainText">When it comes to my skills that I possess, I have very good communication skills - this is because when I talk to people, I tend to maintain eye contact to show that I am directing the information towards the person I am talking to. As well as that, I also tend to use hand gestures and facial expressions to show that I am confident with what I am saying. Another key skill I have that is linked to communication is listening - this allows me to take in information accurately without having to ask the speaker to repeat what they said. Even though I have good verbal communication skills, I also have very good non-verbal communication skills, such as: written communication - this is because I use good, clear English and always use correct spelling and grammar when writing something. Some other skills that I have is that I am polite; have good leadership skills; along with efficient team working skills. Further, I also have good proof reading skills because I feel that it is important to check everything, so that it makes sense and so that there are no spelling or grammar errors. Some other important skills I have are good IT skills, problem solving skills and research skills. I am good with IT because I know how to use a computer as well as key software, such as: Word, Excel and PowerPoint - which mainly revolve around the workplace. When it comes to problem solving, I often use my research skills if I need find out an answer to a problem - if I don't know the answer. But depending on how complex the problem is and what kind of problem it is, I sometimes don't have to use my research skills to find the answer. Also, I feel that I have efficient research skills, whether it is researching problems or topics. In terms of professionalism and leadership skills, I have these skills because I always take a professional approach when talking to different people, by speaking politely and using manners all the time. Regarding my leadership skills, I do have this skill because in my secondary school, I took on a key position. In terms of flexibility and time management, I also take these skills seriously because I believe that it is important to get things done way before time, so that the next task or project can be started.

  <h1 class="MainHeading">Examples of my Skills</h1>
  <!--h1 is a class because it is used multiple times on the document-->	
  <p class="MainText">I have demonstrated my skills through my A-Level ICT course and mentoring at  secondary school. As part of my A-Level
  ICT course, I had to do a presentation to the whole class; when I did this, I used hand gestures, maintained 
  eye contact, used a clear voice and also used facial expressions. For example: when talking about my GCSE results, 
  I used a serious facial expression to emphasise the importance; while talking about some of the things I’m good at,
  I smiled while talking. As well as that, I handed out questionnaires to the audience; from that feedback,
  I found out that I used eye contact regularly, showing that I was engaging with them throughout my presentation. Also,
  as part of my A-Level course, I demonstrated proof reading and communication skills through proof reading someone
  else's CV and cover letter, and taking part in a mock job interview. An example of me proof reading was on the cover letter, 
  where it says” ‘Yours faithfully’, I had to correct the letter ‘f’ to a capital ‘F’.  Although, I did have to correct 
  grammar mistake frequently, there weren’t any spelling mistakes which indicated that the person’s level of 
  English was up to a good standard. And this was an interpersonal skill I only used a few times. In my mock interview,
  I used hand gestures, maintained eye contact, used facial expressions and a clear voice. I know I used these skills
  because from my feedback sheet, it said that I used these skills throughout my interview - this also 
  shows my use of professionalism. Along with that, to show my communication skills, I mentored some students at my secondary school. 
  As a result of this,
  I gained effective communication skills, confidence and team-working skills. Also, to show my leadership skills,
  I was appointed Director of Study at my sixth form so I could be a part of the student voice. Moreover, my research
  skills were evident when doing my A-Level ICT course, as I had to research various things in order to get the 
  piece of work completed. While doing this, I did learn quite a lot of information, too.

  <h1 class="MainHeading">Skills I need to Improve</h1>
  <!--h1 is a class because it is used multiple times on the document-->	
  <p class="MainText">Although, I have good team-working skills, I feel that I need to improve this skills quite significantly because
  sometimes within a team, there can be issues and disagreements, therefore I want to do more group work so I can
  tackle these problems. As a result of doing this, I think that my team-working skills will be better, along with 
  my leadership - which means that everyone within the team can work with each other comfortably. Along with that,
  another skill I want to improve is my confidence. This is an important skill for me that I need to improve because
  when doing presentations and interviews, although I have the main skills for it, I feel that my confidence is 
  letting me down, primarily because I get nervous quite often. I need to improve this skill because it will allow
  me to feel more comfortable when I am taking part in an interview, or giving a presentation - and most importantly, 
  it will be important for me when I am in a real interview for a job.
