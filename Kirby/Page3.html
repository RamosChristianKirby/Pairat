                <p class="ReflectionText">So far in this unit, I have learned about the different business organisations and environment; the systems development life-cycle; management information and decision making; Use Case Modelling; and data modelling. I find this unit interesting when it comes to the assignments; and I also think that I am doing really well in this unit, particularly because everyone in my group is determined, hardworking and want to get the work done on time. In terms of the first assignment, it was fairly easy because everyone had a specific question to focus on; I got the 30 mark question (which was the question with the most marks). Although, when it came to the group work, however, I did find it difficult to work with one group member in particular. Despite that, I have not really found this unit difficult in any way so far. Previously, in my A-Level ICT course, I did a unit on information systems, therefore I believe that this may help me at some point in the future within this unit - my ICT course included topics such as: data flow diagrams, features and functions of information systems; and different department within an organisation.

                <p class="ReflectionText">Although, programming is the most difficult unit, this unit is also quite hard when it comes to the mathematics side. I find the mathematics side in this unit quite difficult at times, primarily because i'm not very good at maths and last time I did maths was at GCSE. Even though the maths side can be difficult at most times, there are specific topic that I fully understand - such as: matrices and vectors. There are some topics that I do find difficult on the mathematics side - this includes: sets and supersets in particular. Overall, I need to put more work into this unit in my spare time and go to the drop in sessions. The other topic which is part of this unit is computer systems. Within the computer systems topic, I have learned about digital logic gate theory and combinations; logic circuits and logic functions; the Decoder, Half Adder, Full Adder; the Karnaugh Map; and the CPU Execute cycle. I feel that I do understand most things as I have completed most of the lab sheets in my own time; however, when it comes to the Decoder, Half Adder and Full Adder, I feel that I need to put more work into these in order to understand them better.
